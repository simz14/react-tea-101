    description:
      "According to legend, tea has been known in China since about 2700 BCE. For millennia it was a medicinal beverage obtained by boiling fresh leaves in water, but around the 3rd century CE it became a daily drink, and tea cultivation and processing began. The first published account of methods of planting, processing, and drinking came in 350 CE. Around 800 the first seeds were brought to Japan, where cultivation became established by the 13th century. Chinese from Amoy brought tea cultivation to the island of Formosa (Taiwan) in 1810. Tea cultivation in Java began under the Dutch, who brought seeds from Japan in 1826 and seeds, workers, and implements from China in 1833.",

    description:
      "White tea is known to be one of the most delicate tea varieties because it is so minimally processed. White tea is harvested before the tea plant’s leaves open fully, when the young buds are still covered by fine white hairs, hence the name “white” tea.These buds and unfurled leaves from the newest growth on the tea plant are handpicked and then quickly and meticulously dried, so the leaves are not allowed to oxidize as long as leaves plucked for green or black tea production. This minimal processing and low oxidation results in some of the most delicate and freshest tea available.",

    description:
      "Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process which is used to make oolong teas and black teas.[1] Green tea originated in China, and since then its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia.Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest.The two main components unique to green tea are catechins and theanine, and the health effects of these components are attracting a great deal of attention in Japan and abroad.",

    name: "Oolong Tea",
    description:
      "It’s made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, the same plant used to make green tea and black tea. The difference is in how the tea is processed.The process of oxidation is what creates green, dark, or oolong teas.Green tea is produced from fresh tea leaves that have not undergone oxidation, a chemical reaction that begins when the leaves are exposed to the air and which is responsible for the color and taste of different types of tea. Black tea is created when leaves are fully crushed to enhance oxidation, and oolong is created when leaves are wilted in the sun and slightly bruised to create partial oxidation ",
